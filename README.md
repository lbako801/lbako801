Hey there! 👋 As a full-stack engineer, I bring a unique blend of tech skills and design prowess to the table. Based in SLC, I've worked on a variety of web development projects, helping local businesses boost their online presence and stand out in a crowded market.

When it comes to front-end expertise, I'm a pro with HTML, CSS, JS, and React - just give me a UI/UX challenge and I'll make it come to life! I'm also skilled in backend and database programming with Node.js, MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL.

Now, when I'm not knee-deep in code, you can find me indulging in a few of my favorite hobbies. I'm a bit of a vintage tech fan, with an appreciation for all things retro and cool 📻. I'm also a motorcycle lover, usually riding everyday 🏍️. And if that weren't enough, I'm a dedicated dungeon master for D&D, always ready to lead my party through a thrilling adventure 🐉.

With my fun and personable approach to work, I'm always looking to connect with the tech community and help bring innovative ideas to life. So let's connect and start building something great together! ⚡️
